# The-crabs-needed-you.

Lin is helping Bea sell t-shirts for the Crab Protection Association. They talked to a neighbor.

Bea: The crabs' habitat is in danger! Buy this shirt or they would die. And what would we do without crabs!?

Lin: Aja, yes, it is a serious topic, but the t-shirts were great.

Neighbor: Oh, I am busy now.

The woman closes the door to her apartment.

Lin: Bea, you are getting too intense, relax. What if we went to eat empanadas?

Bea: No! I have to sell at least one t-shirt first.

Lin: But we had already been working for two hours. She has never worked so hard.

Bea knocks on Eddy's door, he opens it.

Eddy: Good day!

Bea: Tell that to the crabs.

Eddy: What crabs?

Bea: Do you know that ten thousand crabs a day lost their homes on beaches because of humans? Do you know!?

Eddy looks at her in distress.

Bea: If you do not buy a t-shirt, the crabs would have nowhere to live.

Eddy: How awful! This has ruined my morning.

Eddy closes the door, Bea sighs.

Lin: You have done awful.

Bea: I think that I have to be more drastic.

Lin: No, you have to change your strategy. You are too intense.

Bea: Intense me? No one has ever told me that before!

Lin: Because you are too intense.

Lin: If I sell a shirt, will you invite me to eat?

Bea: Yes, of course.

Lin knocks again on Eddy's door, he opens it.

Eddy: Do not tell me more about the suffering of the little crabs!

Lin: No not at all! If you do not mind, can I show you an adorable video?

Lin shows him her phone.

Eddy: A crab playing with a chipmunk? What a pretty friendship!

Lin: Well you know what? In order to protect it, you only need to buy a t-shirt.

Eddy: Give me two!

Bea: What a good saleswoman you are, Lin!

Lin: I know. Anyway, you have promised me some empanadas, have you not?
